This is a real life gif of Trevor coding after midnight during the full moon this weekend.  Bewaaaare the were-cat!!


## Work on your portfolios:

Your portfolio is the best tool to convey your brand, personality and skills in a unique and exciting way that resumes and linkedin simply can't.  We started building a light-weight version of our potential portfolio way back in unit 1.  Tonight we're getting serious.  We're starting the build __The__ portfolio that you'll carry around with you as a developer.  Feel free to build off the light-weight version you've already started or start a new one. Quality is key and sometimes a fresh start goes a long way.


####Considerations:

Is there something on the page about you aside from just being a developer?  Do you have your projects, link to projects, text about projects, and technologies involved?  Is your page unique and interesting?  A specific way of branding yourself can greatly help you stand out from the crowd.

Does the portfolio look good on a large desktop (>1200px width), laptop (>800px), tablet (>550px), and phone (>350px)?


####Deliverables:

* a completed __layout__ for your site __but no content__.  What does this mean? For example, You will have a distinct section for each of your projects as well as places for photos, descriptions and links, but you'll use placeholders for photos and lorem ipsums for the descriptions.  Feel free to curate the content if you want, but it is not required for tonight.  (note: we'll allow time in the future for content.  For now, we want you to go slow and focus on quality rather than rush to meet a hw requirement.)
* __complete everything in greyscale__
* create a github repo on your non-enterprise github to hold your code.
* take screenshots of your website and add them to the readme.
* submit your github repo as an issue, just like a normal assignment.


We'll be giving feedback on each other's portfolios tomorrow morning.  Maybe a little showcase.
